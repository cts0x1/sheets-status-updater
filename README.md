# Sheets Status Updater
### The magical 16 lines that created the beauty of my ranked war helpers, now public.

I've done what I can in adding comments to the script to explain what needs changing.

<sup>Lines 1-5 are the update on open and adding an update button to the script for the owner.</sup>


Line 8 is simple enough. [facID] is the faction you are warring against or 'spying', whilst [apiKey] is just a standard API key that can view basic selections.

This script has been made with the ability to modify and expand on it rather easily though, I hope you find great use with it.

<sup>Lines 9-15 are the useful ones. 
In line 11, change the '52' to however many members the opposing faction has.
In line 13, '10' is what column the 'status' data is updated in, in this case, it is 'J'.
In line 14, '11' is what column the 'last_action' data is updated in, in this case, it is 'K'. </sup>

Merry Christmas and this is my final TORN related update.
It has been a pleasure. o7
